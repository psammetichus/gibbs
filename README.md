# Gibbs
A neurophysiologic analysis suite in Julia and C++

This will eventually be a set of codes and a gui for analysis of neurophysiologic (esp EEG and MEG) signals.

The processing backend is in [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) and we plan to implement a bridge to a Qt GUI through C++.

Initial stage is porting EEGLab and FieldTrip to Julia.
